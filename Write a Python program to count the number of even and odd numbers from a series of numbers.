# define a function to count the number of even and odd numbers
def count_even_odd(numbers):
  # initialize the counters for even and odd numbers
  even_count = 0
  odd_count = 0
  
  # loop through the numbers
  for num in numbers:
    # if the number is even, increment the even count
    if num % 2 == 0:
      even_count += 1
    # if the number is odd, increment the odd count
    else:
      odd_count += 1
      
  # return the count of even and odd numbers
  return even_count, odd_count

# test the function with the sample numbers
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
even_count, odd_count = count_even_odd(numbers)

# print the results
print("Number of even numbers:", even_count)
print("Number of odd numbers:", odd_count)


The output of this program will be:
Number of even numbers: 4
Number of odd numbers: 5
